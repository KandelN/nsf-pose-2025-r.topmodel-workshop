## USGS Potential Evapotranspiration Data

The USGS daily global potential evapotranspiration (PET) [data](https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/product/81) is estimated using climate parameters extracted from the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS), which is run every six hours by [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.noaa.gov/). Its data resolution is 1° by 1°, and data availability starts from January 1, 2001. However, its web interface is limited to single-year, single-month, or single-day downloads.  
The unit of this data product is $0.01 \, \text{mm}$, meaning a cell value of 1 indicates a daily potential evapotranspiration of $0.01 \, \text{mm}$.

## Downloading PET Data

Direct downloads are available from the following directories:

- [Daily directory](https://edcintl.cr.usgs.gov/downloads/sciweb1/shared/fews/web/global/daily/pet/downloads/daily/)
- [Monthly directory](https://edcintl.cr.usgs.gov/downloads/sciweb1/shared/fews/web/global/daily/pet/downloads/monthly/)
- [Yearly directory](https://edcintl.cr.usgs.gov/downloads/sciweb1/shared/fews/web/global/daily/pet/downloads/yearly/)

Using [`fetch_usgs_pet.py`](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/nsf-pose-2025-r.topmodel-workshop/blob/master/scripts/fetch_usgs_pet.py), you can download PET data:

```bash
fetch_usgs_pet.py 2010-01-01 2020-12-31
```

## Extracting Data for the Watershed

From the `epsg4326` location, import all the files using [`import_usgs_pet.sh`](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/nsf-pose-2025-r.topmodel-workshop/blob/master/scripts/import_usgs_pet.sh).

Find the centroid of the watershed:

```bash
v.to.db map=watershed option=coor columns=x,y
v.to.db map=watershed option=area columns=area_km2 units=kilometers
v.db.select map=watershed
```

The major centroid is at $-83.6274554161366, 34.6959628598932$.

Extract PET data at the centroid:

```bash
for i in $(g.list type=raster pattern=et*); do
    r.what map=$i coordinates=-83.6274554161366,34.6959628598932 | sed 's/.*|/0.00001*/' | bc
done > usgs_pet.txt
```

## Creating Input Files

Replace NCDC EVAP data in `input_evap.txt` with this data and create a new `input_pet.txt` file:

```bash
head -9 input_evap.txt > input_pet.txt
tail +10 input_evap.txt | sed 's/ .*//' > ncdc_prcp.txt
tail +10 input_evap.txt | sed 's/.* //' > ncdc_evap.txt
paste ncdc_prcp.txt usgs_pet.txt >> input_pet.txt
```

## Comparing EVAP and PET Data

In R, compare EVAP and PET data:

```r
evap <- read.table("ncdc_evap.txt")[[1]]
pet <- read.table("usgs_pet.txt")[[1]]
boxplot(data.frame(evap, pet))

plot(evap, type = "l")
lines(pet, col = "red")
legend("topleft", legend = c("evap", "pet"), lty = c(1, 1), col = c("black", "red"), bty = "n")
```

Overall, EVAP data is greater than PET data.
