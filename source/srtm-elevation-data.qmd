# SRTM elevation data

## Finding a streamflow gauge

For this workshop, we need to find a watershed that has a streamflow gauge at its outlet for calibration purposes. Go to [StreamStats](https://streamstats.usgs.gov/ss/) and search for `02331600`, which is the name of a United States Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow gauge.

Copy the latitude and longitude to a text editor. We will need this information later.

Select Georgia and delineate a watershed at just the downstream cell of the gauge. Download the watershed Shapefile as [streamstats_02331600_watershed.zip](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/nsf-pose-2025-r.topmodel-workshop/raw/master/data/streamstats_02331600_watershed.zip).

## Downloading the SRTM DEM

Go to [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) and zoom to the area of the watershed above. Draw a polygon that entirely covers the watershed.

We will use the [SRTM DEM](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/). Click Data Sets and search for "SRTM 1 arc-second".

Click Results and download [the GeoTIFF file](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/nsf-pose-2025-r.topmodel-workshop/raw/master/data/n34_w084_1arc_v3.tif).
