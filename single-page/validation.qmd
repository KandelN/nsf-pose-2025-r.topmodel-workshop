## Validating the calibrated model

In R, let's validate our calibrated model using data from 2015 to 2020.

```R
obs_v <- read.table("obs_v.txt")[[1]]
sim_v <- run_rtopmodel(path_v)
write.table(sim_v, "sim_v.txt", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)

calc_nse(obs_v, sim_v, skip_v)
```
This step will create [`output_v.txt`](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/nsf-pose-2025-r.topmodel-workshop/raw/master/data/output_v.txt) and [`sim_v.txt`](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/nsf-pose-2025-r.topmodel-workshop/raw/master/data/sim_v.txt).

My NSE for validation is $0.7745305$, which is not bad. However, baseflows are still not properly simulated.
