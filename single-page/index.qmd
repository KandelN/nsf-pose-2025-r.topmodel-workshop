<!-- # Physically-based hydrologic modeling using GRASS GIS r.topmodel {.unnumbered} -->
# Welcome {.unnumbered #sec-index}

This workshop will introduce r.topmodel (Cho 2000), the GRASS GIS module for a physically-based hydrologic model called TOPMODEL (Beven 1984). r.topmodel is a C implementation of the original FORTRAN code by Beven and tightly integrated with GRASS GIS. We will discuss step-by-step instructions for preparing input data for r.topmodel, running it, calibrating its model parameters, and, finally, post-processing the model outputs.

## Abstract

The Topography Model (TOPMODEL) is "a set of conceptual tools that can be used to reproduce the hydrological behaviour of catchments in a distributed or semi-distributed way, in particular the dynamics of surface of subsurface contributing areas" (Beven et al. 1995). Cho (2000) reimplemented his FORTRAN code as a GRASS GIS module in C, based on which the R package (Buytaert 2009) and SAGA GIS module (Conrad 2003) have been developed (Cho et al. 2019). Cho (2020) developed r.accumulate, an efficient GRASS GIS hydrologic module for calculating one of its parameters. We will use these and other modules to create a r.topmodel model and use R scripts including Isolated-Speciation-based Particle Swarm Optimization (ISPSO) (Cho et al. 2011), a particle swarm optimization algorithm in R, to calibrate its parameters.
